# CLI Game: Adivina el Número (Python)

## 📌 Description
This is a simple command-line game written in Python.  
The program selects a random number between 1 and 100 and the player has to guess it.  
The game gives hints whether the guess is too low or too high and counts the number of attempts.

This project demonstrates Python skills including:

- Loops (`while`)  
- Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)  
- Functions and modular code  
- Error handling (`try-except`)  
- User interaction via console  

Perfect for a portfolio to show **logic and Python fundamentals**.

## 🛠 Technologies
- Python 3 (built-in modules only)
